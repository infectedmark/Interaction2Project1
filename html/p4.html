            I was suddenly a world filled with <span tabindex="0">_____</span>, 
            <span class="span-parent" tabindex="0">_____</span>, and the raw emotions that only jazz could evoke. 
            The expertise of the musicians recalled the likes of Miles Davis and John Coltrane. 
            Bodies began to move, swing and sway, the music and energy in the room rendering 
            it nearly impossible to not do so.
            Time lost its grip in the swinging haven, and I found myself immersed in a world where worries 
            faded, to make room for joy and life. The jazz club became a sanctuary,
             a place where souls connected through the language of music.
